## Elevate your lifestyle. 
Flock is an app where the user tracks meals throughout the day by taking pictures. The AI model evaluates calories and micronutrients, allowing users to journal and elevate their lifestyle. Users can receive meal recommendations, and integrate their account with our industry partners in meal prep delivery.

## How does Flock work?
With our backend ML model, after scanning the respective food with your camera, our script scours our cloud database of nutritional information for a variety of foods. Once a match is made, the respective information (calories, fats, sugar, etc.) is returned to the user. Flock also allows users to journal down the different foods that they consume on a daily basis, see summaries of past logs... truly allowing for a healthy lifestlye to be accessible by everyone.
